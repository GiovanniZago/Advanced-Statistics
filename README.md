# Advanced-Statistics :chart_with_upwards_trend: :electron:

This repository contains the weekly exercises needed for attending the *Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis* mandatory course of the *Physics of Data* Master Degree. The syllabus of the course includes learning the R language in order to carrying out the exercises. The main topics which the exercises refer to are
- Database querying 
- Bayesian inference
- Hypothesis testing
- Monte Carlo methods for posterior sampling

A more advanced topic, i.e. Bayesian Networks, is covered in the the associated repository, and relates to the final project of the course. <br>
I specify that the purpose of this repsitory is merely showcasing what I have done during the course as a demonstration of my skills. I do not take any responsibility for an improper use of my code.
